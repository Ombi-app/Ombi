            Hi!
            <br/>Thanks for the issue report. Before a real human comes by, please make sure you used our bug report format.
            <br/>Have you looked at the wiki yet? https://docs.ombi.app/
            <br/>Before posting make sure you also read our [FAQ](https://docs.ombi.app/info/faq/).
            <br/> Make the title describe your issue. Having 'not working' or 'I get this bug' for 100 issues, isn't really helpful.
            <br/> If we need more information or there is some progress we tag the issue or update the tag and keep you updated.
            <br/> Thanks!
            <br/> Ombi Bot.
