This is based off [Plex Requests by lokenx](https://github.com/lokenx/plexrequests-meteor) so big props to that guy!
I wanted to write a similar application in .Net!

# Features

* Movie and TV Show searching, can't find something on Plex? Just request it! 
* Notifications! Get notified via Email, Pushbullet and Pushover for new requests and issue reports!
* Send your TV Shows to either [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) or [SickRage](http://www.sickrage.ca/)!
* Secure authentication so you don't have to worry about those script kiddies
* We check to see if the request is already in Plex, if it's already in Plex then why you requesting it?!
* We have allowed the ability for a user to add a custom note on a request
* It automatically update the status of requests when they are available on Plex
* Slick, responsive and mobile friendly UI
* Headphones integration!
* Ability to run with a reverse proxy!
