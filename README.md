# Features
Here are some of the features Ombi V3 has:
* Now working without crashes on Linux.
* Lets users request Movies, Music, and TV Shows (whether it being the entire series, an entire season, or even single episodes.)
* Easily manage your requests
* Allows you to set specific users to automatically have requests approved and added to the relevant service (Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Couchpotato etc)
* User management system (supports plex.tv, Emby and local accounts)
* A landing page that will give you the availability of your Plex/Emby server and also add custom notification text to inform your users of downtime.
* Allows your users to get custom notifications!
* Secure authentication using best practises
* Will show if the request is already on plex or even if it's already monitored.
* Automatically updates the status of requests when they are available on Plex/Emby
